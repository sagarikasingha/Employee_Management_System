# Employee_Management_System
The Employment Management System is a web-based application designed to manage employee data efficiently. The system allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data, including adding new employees, viewing existing employee information, updating employee details, and deleting employee records.

# Backend (Spring Boot):
The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot, a popular Java-based framework for building web applications. The application uses Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the MySQL database.

# Database (MySQL):
The application uses MySQL as the database management system to store employee data. The database schema consists of two tables: employees and roles. The employees table stores employee information, including employee ID, name, email, and role ID. The roles table stores role information, including role ID and role name.

# Frontend (React):
The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application uses React Hooks to manage state and side effects. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing administrators to easily perform CRUD operations on employee data.

# REST API:
The application exposes a REST API that allows the frontend to interact with the backend. The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee data. The API uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the data format for exchanging data between the frontend and backend.
